        1. 90 days before the date of the general meeting for any other proposed resolution.

    1. Subject to Bylaw 8.3, the directors may either:

        1. accept any proposed resolution submitted pursuant to Bylaw 8.1, in which case the proposed resolution will be submitted to a vote of the members; or

No nominations of candidates for election of directors in any election will be accepted after the close of nominations.

        1. the member did not vote, or voted for more than a specified number of candidates, or

        1. it appears that the member voted more than once, in which case none of the votes cast by the member will be counted.

    1. In the event of an interruption of normal postal service or any sustained unavailability of the interactive website contemplated at Bylaw 8.5.2, the directors may extend the time for doing anything required in an election, and any director whose term was to end at the annual general meeting continues in office until the election is concluded.
